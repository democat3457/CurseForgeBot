# This sets the text that appears as the message description in the update notification
# (the text directly under the project name which is the message title)
#

# Provide a language syntax name to have the changelog formatted inside the embeded message for easier viewing if desired.

# When using github as cache storage, you can also specify an custom repository name
# This bot will create an new (private) one, if none with this name exists
